# Uncommon HTML Bug: Unexpected Hidden Attribute Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the `hidden` attribute in HTML when used in conjunction with JavaScript.  The problem stems from the way the `hidden` attribute interacts with the asynchronous nature of JavaScript and browser rendering.

## Bug Description

The bug lies in how the `hidden` attribute is toggled using JavaScript.  Initially, setting `hidden` to `true` works as intended, hiding the element. However, immediately after, setting `hidden` to `false` fails to make the element visible in some browsers and scenarios. This is because the rendering of the change hasn't yet happened when the line is executed. This might lead to unexpected visual results where elements remain hidden even after the JavaScript code intends to show them.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the changes to the `hidden` attribute are handled properly with an appropriate delay mechanism to allow the browser's rendering cycle to complete.
